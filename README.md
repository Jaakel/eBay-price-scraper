# eBay-price-scraper
This script scrapes eBay Australia for listings based on a user-provided search keyword. It extracts details such as the product name, price, postage cost, total cost, condition, brand, model, and other metadata. The results are saved to a CSV file, and key statistics (e.g., lowest price, median price, Q1, Q3) are calculated and logged.
